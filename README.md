#Counter Strike Steam Market Data Requester

i wrote a part of this a while ago, if you can figure it out go ahead, its a little script that should take any map's item set and request it from steam, maybe ill come back and make this more user friendly in a few weeks, or youre reading this a year+ from now and youre pissed i didnt lol.

in short, you should be able to build a url from steam, get the api response and then print it. I was going to use that one steam API site but it costed money so i made a slapdash version of it
